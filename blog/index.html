					<h2>Failure</h2>
					<h2>🎙️ The Conways</h2>
					<h2>💿 Falling Short</h2><br>
					<p>Now THIS is a song you can't get on Spotify! The only source for this song I could find was its Bandcamp page, where it says it was recorded back in March of 2000. From what I can tell, The Conways are a side-project band made up of Tim Rogner (Allister, Hot Alice), and likely Scott Murphy (Allister, MONOEYES) and Mike Leverence (Allister). Idk who Dan is. OH WAIT I FORGOT TO REVIEW THE SONG! It sounds pretty cool, having a more indie feel to it than most of Allister's songs. But, I still like some other songs off of the album better.<br><i class='rating'>Rating: 7 / 10</i></p>

					<h2>You Say GOODBYE</h2>
					<h2>🎙️ SpecialThanks</h2>
					<h2>💿 SEVEN COLORS</h2><br>
					<p>FIRST SONG OF THE FIRST WEEK OF THE NEW YEAR, WOOHOO! From SpecialThanks' debut album, this song is about the experience of standing on a stage and doing a concert ... i think. Although I do enjoy it's pop-rock energy, I still find myself enoying the more punk songs off the album more, but it's still good!<br><i class='rating'>Rating: 7.5 / 10</i></p>
